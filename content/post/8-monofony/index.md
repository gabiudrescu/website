*Translator note: once I saw the [original article](https://afsy.fr/avent/2019/22-monofony-base-sur-la-structure-interne-de-sylius) shared on Sylius Slack, I thought it would be useful to translate it in English, as my French is not that good; this should help me in the future when someone asks me why use Monofony and why is this package that great; I also took the liberty to adapt the original article with some of my additions*
