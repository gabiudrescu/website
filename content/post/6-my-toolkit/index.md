We rarely have the chance of starting a new project as often as we would like. Most of the time, we have to handle existing projects and we need to adapt our expectations and internal processes in order to build or improve something.

At least that's how it is in my business area. 

That's why whenever I have the chance, as a product owner, to get on board of a greenfield project, I get over-excited and try to implement as many good practices I can, so at a later point, I can benefit from those early efforts.

And that's how I realized how often we overlook the work on templatization of various stuff we use on a day to day activity.

# Technical stuff

As a part-time, amateur programmer, I always stay a few hours to setup the environment required for my app to say "Hello, world". 

IDE, programming language runtime, database, server, yada-yada... 

Everything takes time and by the time I got everything up and running, I lose my interest and decide to do something else.

# Business stuff
Usually, whenever I change the business context it's when either I'm switching between jobs or I'm helping someone else than my current employer, as a freelance project. 

And then I have to go again through all the setup of everything:

 - emails
 - domain
 - hosting
 - business discovery
 - team formation
 - process analysis
 - choosing the right tools for the right job

This, again, takes time and it is prone to error because you don't really remember everything by heart, upfront. Most probably, you'll remember
