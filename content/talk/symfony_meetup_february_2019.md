Most of the software we build has a persistence layer where we store the information we handle.  
  
Either we're talking about a traditional, relational database, or a more modern non-relational, Doctrine is a great fit for our Symfony Apps, making it easier and familiar for us to "talk" to the database through an Object Oriented API.  
  
Ciprian Popescu, Tech Lead @ DreamLabs, will have a "Doctrine Masterclass", a crash course with lots of practical examples on „advanced query building, filtering and inheritance mappings”.  
  
We thank Zitec for sponsoring this meetup and we're very glad to work together, again. We all look forward to see your new offices, that we heard much about them: [https://offices.zitec.com/](https://offices.zitec.com/ "https://offices.zitec.com/")
