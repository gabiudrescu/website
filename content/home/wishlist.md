So, I decided to make a list of stuff I am planning to buy. 

I managed to save quite a lot of money through [Revolut Vaults](https://www.revolut.com/save-money-with-vaults) and I guess it's better to create a list to better prioritize my wishes.

 - [x] Trip to Rome
 - [ ] Fire extinguisher
 - [ ] Smoke and CO detector
 - [ ] Robot vacuum cleaner 
 - [ ] Dishwasher
 - [ ] Convertible
