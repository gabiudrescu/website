So, I decided to make a list of stuff I am planning to buy. 

I managed to save quite a lot of money through [Revolut Vaults](https://www.revolut.com/save-money-with-vaults) and I guess it's better to create a list to better prioritize my wishes.

 - [x] Trip to Rome
 - [ ] Fire extinguisher
 - [ ] Smoke and CO detector
 - [ ] Robot vacuum cleaner 
 - [ ] Dishwasher machine
 - [ ] Visit New York
 - [ ] Visit San Francisco
 - [ ] Visit South-east Asia (Thailand, Philipines, Indonesia etc.)
 - [ ] Visit Australia
 - [ ] [Rayban sun glasses](https://www.ray-ban.com/portugal/sunglasses/RB2140%20UNISEX%20093-original%20wayfarer%20classic-black/805289126591?category_Id=328583)

I'm making this list mostly for my own use, as new wishes emerge on a daily basis. This is a reminder for what I actually considered important enough to put down on this page, more or less as a public commitment to myself that one day, I'm going to own or do what I wrote here. 

If you want to chip in and give me a helping hand to achieve something from the list above, I'd highly appreciate a consultation first :) [see the contact form]({{< ref "/#contact" >}}).
